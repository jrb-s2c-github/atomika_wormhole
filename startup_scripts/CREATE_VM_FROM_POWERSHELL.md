Google how to enable HyperV on Windows should it not be enabled

Ensure that HyperV has the Default Network Switch, otherwise create it. Virtual machines on the default switch are 
assigned internal IP's. It remains an outstanding task to have the same IP assigned after reboots.

One can also create a virtual switch with a dedicated adaptor, e.g. ethernet cable should your PC normally use Wi-Fi. 
This might be more stable than the Default Switch since the ip address will be assigned by DHCP. The best solution is 
actually to configure a static ip address. The switch name can be changed in the "New-VM" command below using the 
-SwitchName setting.

## The following formed the base of liftoff.ps1:

Run this command to set the location of the Ubuntu22 boot image:
```
Set-Variable VDiskHome C:\Users\janr\vm_disks\ISO
```
Set-Variable Name ubuntu22AO
```
Copy, paste and run all the commands below to create and start an Ubuntu22 VM in one go:
New-VM -Name $Name -MemoryStartupBytes 4GB -NewVHDPath $Name+'.vhdx' -NewVHDSizeBytes 20GB -SwitchName 'Default Switch' 
Set-VM -Name $Name -ProcessorCount 4 -StaticMemory 
Add-VMDvdDrive -VMName "$Name" -Path $VDiskHome\ubuntu-22.04-atomika-autoinstall.iso
Start-VM -Name $Name 
Get-VM -Name  $Name | select -ExpandProperty NetworkAdapters | select VMname, Name, IPAddresses
```
More than one enter press might be required until there is a clean prompt again

This sequence of commands should be run for as many nodes as are required in the cluster.
